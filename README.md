This project is used to update the main Apache Struts website http://struts.apache.org/
You must manually push changes to production via SVN.

Site is generated by Jekyll and uses pure html either markdown format.
To test website locally you can use the below command:

 > bundle exec jekyll serve -w --trace --host 0.0.0.0

or you can use `Docker`` (please install it first) with one of the provided scripts:

 > ./docker-run.fish

when running fish-shell, or:

 > ./docker-run.sh

when running Bash or Sh.

All pages are generated into 'content' folder.

There are two scripts used to build the image but this should be used only when `Dockerfile` was modified.
