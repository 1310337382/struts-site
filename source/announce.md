#### 6 May 2015 - Struts 2.3.20.1 General Availability with Security Fix Release {#a20150506}

The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts 2.3.20.1 is available as a "General Availability"
release. The GA designation is our highest quality grade.

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications.
The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying,
to maintaining applications over time.

One medium security issue was solved with this release:

  - [S2-024](/docs/s2-024.html)
    Wrong `excludeParams` overrides those defined in `DefaultExcludedPatternsChecker`

**All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.**

The 2.3.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum requirement of the following specification versions:
Servlet API 2.4, JSP API 2.0, and Java 6.

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts framework,
please post your comments to the user list, and, if appropriate, file a tracking ticket.
